# Pikmin1Toolset
A collection of tools for Pikmin 1.  This includes mod2obj, obj2mod and other tools.
# mod2obj and obj2mod
mod2obj can read straight from a .mod file and creates an obj, any texture files in txe format along with an ini. Rigged models do not work currently. obj2mod will take an obj and convert it into a number of .bin sections, you will need to grab pidi's ModPacker tool in order to combine all of these into a .mod.
